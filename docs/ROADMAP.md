Want to contribute to any of these features? 

I accept and encourage AI PRs, but they must be:

1. Small, focused changes or fixes;
2. A completely new/distinguished/specific MODULAR change or feature.

Which means:

A big block of code in 1 or 2 places? Awesome!
A complete new, separate file with 2 or 3 lines all around? Perfect!
One (or 3) small 1-3 line changes? That may be really helpful.
Lots of small changes all over several different files? Let's talk about this first.

Also, you can always open an issue to discuss your ideas!
